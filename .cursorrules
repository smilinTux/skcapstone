# SKCapstone — Cursor Agent Rules

## Multi-Agent Coordination (REQUIRED)

At the START of every session, run: skcapstone coord briefing

This teaches you the full coordination protocol. It works in any terminal.

Quick commands:
  skcapstone coord status                   # See what's available
  skcapstone coord claim <id> --agent <you> # Claim work
  skcapstone coord complete <id> --agent <you> # Mark done
  skcapstone coord create --title "..." --by <you> # New task
  skcapstone coord board                    # Regenerate BOARD.md

The coordination board lives at ~/.skcapstone/coordination/ and syncs
via Syncthing. Only write to YOUR OWN agent file. Tasks are immutable
after creation.

## Skill Available

If the skcapstone-coordination skill is available in your skills list,
read it for the full detailed protocol. Otherwise, `skcapstone coord briefing`
gives you everything you need.

## Code Conventions

- Python 3.11+, PEP 8, black formatting
- Type hints on all functions
- Pydantic for data validation
- Google-style docstrings
- Pytest tests in /tests mirroring src structure
- Max 500 lines per file — split into modules if approaching
